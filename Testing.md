# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Password Exposure (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The `/user/:userId` endpoint was returning the `secretWord` field in plain text, allowing anyone to fetch any user's password.

**Fix**: Removed `secretWord` from the user endpoint response in `server.js` line ~450.

**Before**:
```javascript
res.json({ 
    // ... other fields
    secretWord: user.secretWord || null,  
    // ... other fields
})
```

**After**:
```javascript
res.json({ 
    // ... other fields
    // secretWord removed completely 
    // ... other fields
})
```

### 2. Private Chat Access Control (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Private chats were accessible via public URLs without authentication checks.

**Fix**: Added authentication and authorization checks to chat endpoints.

**Changes**:
- `/api/chat/:chatId` now requires `userId` parameter
- Added private chat member validation
- Returns 401/403 for unauthorized access

### 3. Weak Content Filtering (HIGH)
**Problem**: Content filter was too aggressive (banning "hello") and easily bypassed.

**Fix**: Improved the `containsBadWord()` function with:
- More precise word matching
- Reduced false positives
- Better normalization of input text

### 4. Client-Side Authentication (HIGH)
**Problem**: Password validation was happening on the client side.

**Fix**: Created secure server-side login endpoint `/api/login` with:
- Server-side credential validation
- Session token generation
- Proper error handling

### 5. Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: No protection against brute force attacks.

**Fix**: Added rate limiting middleware:
- 5 login attempts per minute
- 3 registrations per 5 minutes
- 10 requests per minute for other endpoints

## Files Modified

1. **server.js**
   - Removed password exposure from user endpoint
   - Added private chat access control
   - Improved content filtering
   - Added secure login endpoint
   - Added rate limiting middleware

2. **public/welcome.html**
   - Updated to use secure login endpoint
   - Added session token storage

3. **public/chat.html**
   - Added userId parameter to chat requests
   - Improved authentication flow

## Testing

Run the security test script:
```bash
node test-security-fixes.js
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Hash Passwords**: Store hashed versions of secret words instead of plain text
2. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production
3. **Session Management**: Implement proper session expiration and cleanup
4. **Input Validation**: Add more comprehensive input validation
5. **Audit Logging**: Log security events for monitoring

## Verification

To verify fixes are working:

1. **Password Exposure**: Try accessing `/user/{any-user-id}` - should not return `secretWord`
2. **Private Chats**: Try accessing private chat without being a member - should return 403
3. **Content Filter**: Try registering with "hello" - should work now
4. **Rate Limiting**: Make multiple rapid requests - should get 429 after limit
5. **Secure Login**: Use `/api/login` endpoint instead of client-side validation

All critical vulnerabilities from the screenshots have been addressed.
